Cell walls are found in bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and algae. The cell wall envelopes the inner or plasma membrane in all bacteria and is surrounded by the outer membrane in bacteria with 2 membranes (Gram-negative). Bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan while those of archaea are not made of peptidoglycan, but some archaea may contain pseudopeptidoglycan, which is composed of N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid, instead of N-acetyl muramic acid in peptidoglycan. The plant cell wall is made of fibrils of cellulose embedded in a matrix of several other kinds of polymers such as pectin and lignin. Algal cell walls are usually composed of cellulose, glycoproteins, sporopollenin, calcium and various polysaccharides such as manosyl, xylanes, alginic acid. Diatom cell walls (or frustules) contain silica. The cell wall plays a role in cell shape, cell stability and development, and protection against environmental dangers.</text><text class="subcell_name" property="name" visibility="hidden">Cell wall</text>

Each mitochondrion is surrounded by a double limiting membrane. The inner membrane is highly invaginated, and its projections are called cristae. Mitochondria are the sites of the reactions of oxidative phosphorylation, which result in the formation of ATP. The size and coding capacity of the mitochondrial DNA varies considerably in different organisms, and encodes rRNAs, tRNAs and essential mitochondrial proteins.</text><text class="subcell_name" property="name" visibility="hidden">Mitochondrion</text>

The membrane is a continuation of the outer nuclear membrane, it encloses the cytosol cisternal spaces (or internal lumen), which are continuous with the nuclear periplasmic space. The ER sustains many general functions, including protein synthesis, protein modification, protein folding, insertion of membrane proteins, sequestration of calcium, production of phospholipids and steroids and transport of proteins destined for membranes and secretion.</text><text class="subcell_name" property="name" visibility="hidden">Endoplasmic reticulum</text>

The interphase nucleolus is organized around the tandemly repeated genes for preribosomal RNA (rRNA). It is composed of at least 2 sub-compartments: the dense fibrillar component (DFC, also called pars fibrosa) and the granular component (GC or pars granulosa). The DFC contains newly synthesized preribosomal RNA and a collection of proteins; the GC is made up of nearly completed preribosomal particles destined for the cytoplasm. In most metazoans, but generally not in lower eukaryotes, a third component, the fibrillar center (FC), can be seen. Plant and animal nuclei can contain more than one nucleolus.</text><text class="subcell_name" property="name" visibility="hidden">Nucleolus</text>

CBs contain newly assembled small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) particles, which are involved in pre-mRNA splicing and in ribosomal RNA processing, respectively. Mammalian nucleus in interphase, show 2-6 CBs, as irregular, punctuate structures, which vary in size and shape and which are often juxtaposed to nucleoli. At the electronic-microscope level, they are composed of heterogeneous mixture of electro-dense particles with diameters ranging from 20-25 nm and are called coiled body. Structures similar to CBs have been identified in the amphibian oocyte nucleus (called sphere organelles) and in insect (called endobodies). CBs are motile and dynamic structures. Both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between CBs and other nuclear locations depending on the transcriptional state of the cell.</text><text class="subcell_name" property="name" visibility="hidden">Cajal body</text>

Protein found in speckles serves as a reservoir of factors that participate in transcription and pre-mRNA processing. Speckles appear, at the immunofluorescence-microscope level, as irregular, punctuate structures, which vary in size and shape. Usually 25-50 speckles are observed per interphase mammalian nucleus. At the electronic-microscope level, they are composed of heterogeneous mixture of electro-dense particles with diameters ranging from 20-25 nm and are called interchromatin granules clusters (IGCs). Speckles are dynamic structures. Both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations depending on the transcriptional state of the cell. Structures similar to nuclear speckles have been identified in the amphibian oocyte nucleus (called B snurposomes) and in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, but not in yeast.</text><text class="subcell_name" property="name" visibility="hidden">Nucleus speckle</text>

In mammalian cells, the Golgi apparatus is juxtanuclear, often pericentriolar. The stacks are connected laterally by tubules to create a perinuclear ribbon structure, the 'Golgi ribbon'. In plants and lower animal cells, the Golgi exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. The Golgi is a polarized structure with, in most higher eukaryotic cells, a cis-face associated with a tubular reticular network of membranes facing the endoplasmic reticulum, the cis-Golgi network (CGN), a medial area of disk-shaped flattened cisternae, and a trans-face associated with another tubular reticular membrane network, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) directed toward the plasma membrane and compartments of the endocytic pathway. The Golgi apparatus receives the entire output of de novo synthesized polypeptides from the ER, and functions to posttranslationally process and sort them within vesicles destined to their proper final destination (e.g. plasma membrane, endosomes, lysosomes).</text><text class="subcell_name" property="name" visibility="hidden">Golgi apparatus</text>

The precise form and function of vacuoles may vary between phyla. Plant vacuoles are among the best characterized. They differ in terms of their lumenal contents and processing enzymes, as well as on the basis of the type of integral proteins in their membranes (tonoplast intrinsic proteins, TIPs). Examples include the lytic vacuole, the storage vacuole and the lutoid. One important function of plant vacuoles is the maintenance of hydrostatic pressure. Other eukaryotes employ vacuoles for a variety of purposes, including storage (as in the yeast lysosome/vacuole), secretion and phagocytosis. In Protozoa, contractile vacuoles can be used to discharge water from the cytoplasm to the external environment. Aquatic microorganisms may employ gas vacuoles (composed of clusters of inert gas vesicles) to provide buoyancy.</text><text class="subcell_name" property="name" visibility="hidden">Vacuole</text>
